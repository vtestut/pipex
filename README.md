# pipex

Welcome to my `pipex` project !  
In this crucial project we must recreate the functionality of the pipes.

## Project Overview

The `pipex` project introduces students to process creation and management, input/output redirection, and the use of pipes. Key features include:

- **Process Execution:**
  - Create and manage multiple processes for command execution.

- **Input/Output Redirection:**
  - Implement redirection of input and output to and from files.

- **Pipes:**
  - Use pipes to connect the standard output of one process to the standard input of another.

## Contents

- **`/srcs/`:** Contains the source files, including the main `pipex` program.
- **`/include/`:** Header files, including `pipex.h`.
- **`/tests/`:** Directory for test cases and additional testing scripts.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `/srcs/` directory and review the source files.
3. Compile the project using the provided Makefile (`make`).
4. Run the executable with the specified command and arguments (`./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 file2`).

Special thanks to Ecole 42 for the inspiration and learning opportunity.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
